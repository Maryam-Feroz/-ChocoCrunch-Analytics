# üç´ ChocoCrunch Analytics : Sweet Insights, Bitter Truths

A complete chocolate product analytics platform with ETL, SQL insights, and interactive dashboards using Python and Streamlit.

## üì£ Problem Statement

You‚Äôre a Data Analyst at a nutrition research firm analyzing the global chocolate market. The goal of this project is to:
- Extract chocolate product data from the OpenFoodFacts API.
- Clean, transform, and enrich the data with derived nutritional metrics.
- Store the processed data in a SQL database for querying and analysis.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and SQL-based insights.
- Visualize findings interactively through Streamlit dashboards.

## üìä Business Use Cases

- Identify calorie and sugar-heavy chocolate products.
- Track ultra-processed chocolate trends via NOVA classification.
- Compare brands based on healthiness (calories & sugar).
- Categorize products based on derived calorie and sugar classes.
- Provide interactive dashboards for stakeholders to explore product insights.

## ‚ú® Key Features

#### ETL Pipeline
- Fetches 14,496+ chocolate products from OpenFoodFacts API.
- Cleans raw data, imputes missing values, standardizes units.
- Creates derived metrics: sugar_to_carb_ratio, calorie_category, sugar_category, and is_ultra_processed.
- Saves three versions: raw, cleaned, and engineered CSV datasets.

#### Database & SQL Insights
- Inserts processed data into a MySQL database.
- Includes predefined queries for average nutrient values, brand-wise product counts, ultra-processed analysis, and more.
- Enables dynamic SQL querying for stakeholder analysis.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations
- Bar Charts: Number of products per calorie_category, top 10 brands by average calories.
- Pie Charts: Product distribution by NOVA classification (nova_group).
- Scatter Plots: Calories vs sugar content.
- Boxplots: Distribution of sugar_to_carb_ratio across brands.
- Treemaps: Product count by brand and calorie_category.
- Heatmaps: Correlation between calories, sugars, and fat.
- Stacked Bars & KPI Cards: Ultra-processed vs minimally 
- processed product counts, average calories, and sugars per brand.

All visualizations are interactive, making insights immediately actionable for decision-makers.
